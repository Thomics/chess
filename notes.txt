Pawn Moves:
- Moves forward one square - unless, it's the first move (Then one or two).
- Can take a piece diagonally (assuming that moving doesn't put their king in check)
- If the pawn is on a square and another pawn moves two squares right next to it, it can take the other pawn
via en passant (only directly after the pawn is moved).
- Pawns can only move forward
- When a pawn reaches the opposite side of the board, it can turn in to a (Knight, Bishop, Rook, Queen)

If a pawn is on a square, make a list of available moves.


Revisit Rook having check horizontal/vertical and combine if possible.
